# Fantasy-RTS

A fantasy real-time strategy game in the style of Dwarf Fortress. For now without a name. The main target is to create a game which provides the excellent fortress mode with a stable performance and full mod support. Currently it is developed using Python and Pygame but this may change in the future. There will probably be a switch to C++ and SDL/SFML for desktop and a yet to decide game engine for mobile platforms.

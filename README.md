# Fantasy-RTS

A fantasy real-time strategy game in the style of Dwarf Fortress. For now without a name. The main target is to create a game which provides the excellent fortress mode with a stable performance and full mod support. The prototype was developed using Python and Pygame (see directory "python-prototype"). It is now developed in C++. Beside the mod support as a core factor it will later support mobile platforms like Android and iOS.

# A* Benchmark

Benchmark can be enabled by using `DEFINES+=A_STAR_BENCHMARK` in the additional arguments of qmake for the plugins VanillaModel and VanillaDemo.

Benchmarks were executed in Release mode. Git commit `93871f912972ca3749553698205c91e87e2d04bb`.

## Current implementation

    findNeighborsTime = 2987ms, loopTime = 4432ms, teleportTime = 726ms, totalTime = 4763ms, walkTime = 482ms
    findNeighborsTime = 2928ms, loopTime = 4384ms, teleportTime = 715ms, totalTime = 4759ms, walkTime = 492ms
    findNeighborsTime = 2859ms, loopTime = 4380ms, teleportTime = 703ms, totalTime = 4768ms, walkTime = 548ms
    
Holy shit it got faster and a lot. Approximately by a factor of 5 to 6. Checking if there where paths found and which length they had did show plausible results. The performance improvement is even visible ingame.

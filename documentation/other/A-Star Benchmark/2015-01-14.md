# A* Benchmark

Benchmark can be enabled by using `DEFINES+=A_STAR_BENCHMARK` in the additional arguments of qmake for the plugins VanillaModel and VanillaDemo.

Benchmarks were executed in Release mode. Git commit `93871f912972ca3749553698205c91e87e2d04bb`.

## Current implementation

    findNeighborsTime = 2987ms, loopTime = 4432ms, teleportTime = 726ms, totalTime = 4763ms, walkTime = 482ms
    findNeighborsTime = 2928ms, loopTime = 4384ms, teleportTime = 715ms, totalTime = 4759ms, walkTime = 492ms
    findNeighborsTime = 2859ms, loopTime = 4380ms, teleportTime = 703ms, totalTime = 4768ms, walkTime = 548ms
    
Holy shit it got faster and a lot. Approximately by a factor of 5 to 6. Checking if there where paths found and which length they had did show plausible results. The performance improvement is even visible ingame.
    
After some testing the main reason for this improvement is the better hash function of points. Using stl hash, equal and less did also make a small improvement.
   
## Cached Hash for IDs

    findNeighborsTime = 2747ms, loopTime = 4231ms, teleportTime = 706ms, totalTime = 4621ms, walkTime = 499ms
    findNeighborsTime = 2774ms, loopTime = 4215ms, teleportTime = 667ms, totalTime = 4600ms, walkTime = 501ms
    findNeighborsTime = 2804ms, loopTime = 4299ms, teleportTime = 740ms, totalTime = 4649ms, walkTime = 488ms

Small improvement. Biggest advantage is hiding the hash function inside the implementation.

## Cached Hash for IDs and Points

### With Caching

    findNeighborsTime = 2799ms, loopTime = 4322ms, teleportTime = 728ms, totalTime = 4705ms, walkTime = 514ms
    findNeighborsTime = 2861ms, loopTime = 4307ms, teleportTime = 723ms, totalTime = 4680ms, walkTime = 477ms
    findNeighborsTime = 2816ms, loopTime = 4307ms, teleportTime = 682ms, totalTime = 4677ms, walkTime = 506ms

### Without Caching

    findNeighborsTime = 2820ms, loopTime = 4264ms, teleportTime = 687ms, totalTime = 4620ms, walkTime = 486ms
    findNeighborsTime = 2769ms, loopTime = 4247ms, teleportTime = 708ms, totalTime = 4630ms, walkTime = 475ms
    findNeighborsTime = 2831ms, loopTime = 4270ms, teleportTime = 721ms, totalTime = 4624ms, walkTime = 428ms
    
Caching doesn't make any difference. Main advantage is hiding the hash function.

## std::any_of for blocks()

    findNeighborsTime = 2869ms, loopTime = 4341ms, teleportTime = 742ms, totalTime = 4664ms, walkTime = 479ms
    findNeighborsTime = 2736ms, loopTime = 4282ms, teleportTime = 741ms, totalTime = 4669ms, walkTime = 525ms
    findNeighborsTime = 2829ms, loopTime = 4258ms, teleportTime = 701ms, totalTime = 4657ms, walkTime = 506ms

No difference.

## FAST_POS_BLOCK

    findNeighborsTime = 2555ms, loopTime = 3941ms, teleportTime = 624ms, totalTime = 4353ms, walkTime = 523ms
    findNeighborsTime = 2612ms, loopTime = 4031ms, teleportTime = 665ms, totalTime = 4385ms, walkTime = 509ms
    findNeighborsTime = 2525ms, loopTime = 3953ms, teleportTime = 663ms, totalTime = 4353ms, walkTime = 507ms

Approx 7% faster. Currently won't be activated.

## End result

No performance improvement but a lot of code quality.

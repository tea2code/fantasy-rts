# A* Benchmark

Benchmark can be enabled by using `DEFINES+=A_STAR_BENCHMARK` in the additional arguments of qmake for the plugins VanillaModel and VanillaDemo.

Benchmarks were executed in Release mode. Git commit `a61a2f2c7838406d52b5f7951b5e37de6ea05185`.

## Current implementation

    findNeighborsTime = 16841ms, loopTime = 24461ms, teleportTime = 3115ms, totalTime = 26286ms, walkTime = 3419ms
    findNeighborsTime = 17046ms, loopTime = 24717ms, teleportTime = 3205ms, totalTime = 26332ms, walkTime = 3360ms
    findNeighborsTime = 16978ms, loopTime = 24548ms, teleportTime = 3134ms, totalTime = 26298ms, walkTime = 3334ms
    
Another run after odd results from **Use frontier.insert() instead of frontier.emplace()**:

    findNeighborsTime = 16391ms, loopTime = 24022ms, teleportTime = 3180ms, totalTime = 25543ms, walkTime = 3339ms
    
## Current implementation without fast IDs

    findNeighborsTime = 17269ms, loopTime = 24844ms, teleportTime = 3192ms, totalTime = 26407ms, walkTime = 3285ms
    findNeighborsTime = 17077ms, loopTime = 24750ms, teleportTime = 3237ms, totalTime = 26387ms, walkTime = 3347ms
    findNeighborsTime = 17233ms, loopTime = 24782ms, teleportTime = 3106ms, totalTime = 26452ms, walkTime = 3325ms
    
Sadly it doesn't make a lot difference. 
    
## Use frontier.insert() instead of frontier.emplace()

Reason to test this was this excellent talk by [Scott Meyer on effective C++](http://youtu.be/smqT9Io_bKo).

    findNeighborsTime = 16527ms, loopTime = 23961ms, teleportTime = 3155ms, totalTime = 25589ms, walkTime = 3228ms
    findNeighborsTime = 16393ms, loopTime = 23903ms, teleportTime = 3102ms, totalTime = 25473ms, walkTime = 3298ms
    findNeighborsTime = 16409ms, loopTime = 23942ms, teleportTime = 3156ms, totalTime = 25562ms, walkTime = 3323ms
    
These results are odd. Seems like the system had some fluctuations because these change cannot affect `findNeighborsTime` yet it has improved. Did another run of **Current implementation** which confirms it.
    
## Ordered set for BlockSet with naive for loop.

    findNeighborsTime = 16485ms, loopTime = 24024ms, teleportTime = 3223ms, totalTime = 25669ms, walkTime = 3220ms
    findNeighborsTime = 16512ms, loopTime = 23926ms, teleportTime = 3252ms, totalTime = 25583ms, walkTime = 3137ms
    findNeighborsTime = 16337ms, loopTime = 23891ms, teleportTime = 3166ms, totalTime = 25509ms, walkTime = 3320ms
    
## Ordered set for BlockSet with std::set_intersection()

    findNeighborsTime = 16444ms, loopTime = 23934ms, teleportTime = 3218ms, totalTime = 25656ms, walkTime = 3188ms
    findNeighborsTime = 16518ms, loopTime = 23937ms, teleportTime = 3188ms, totalTime = 25604ms, walkTime = 3186ms
    findNeighborsTime = 16301ms, loopTime = 23863ms, teleportTime = 3247ms, totalTime = 25565ms, walkTime = 3262ms
    
## End result

No test has shown any improvement so let's just stick with the original implementation.
